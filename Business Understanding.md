# Business Understanding
A business owner wishes to establish the best place to open a new Indian Restaurant in New York City. The aim is to determine if there is a certain clustering of Indian restaurants and if there are any potential gaps in areas where there could be football.   However they are that if there are many other similar restaurants in the region, customers may not be so inclined to visit. 
For this K-clustering will be used to analyse the various regions of the city with regards to Indian Restaurants. The data will be obtained from foursquare api and the maps as a .json files from https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset and https://maps.princeton.edu/catalog/nyu-2451-34561
