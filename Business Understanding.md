# Business Understanding: My fathers dream 
The aim is to determine if there is a certain clustering of Indian restaurants in New York City, New York, US. A new restaurateur (my own father) wishes to establish where and why the best location to start his new restaurant business is. His lifelong dream was to own a kitchen of his own, with outstanding cookery skills, he is sure the business will be a triumph.  However he is concerned about footfall and if there are many other similar restaurants in the region people will not be so inclined to visit. By some fortune, he established great wealth, meaning that any location and property in New York City is available to him. 
In addition this information may be of great use to other restaurant businesses in the area.


For this K-clustering will be used to analyse the various regions of the city with regards to Indian cuisine. The data will be obtained from foursquare and the maps as a .json from https://cocl.us/new_york_dataset. This is somewhat similar to the previous labcourses but will be over a larger area (i.e the whole city).
By the end of this exercise we will have helped to fulfil a manâ€™s lifetime goal.
